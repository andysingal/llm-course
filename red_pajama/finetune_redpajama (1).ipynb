        "[Llama](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/), the large language model from Meta was [_effectively_ released](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files) to the world a little over two months ago, resulting in an explosion of [experimentation](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor), [exploration](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) and [innovation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Unfortunately Llama has a fairly restrictive \"research-only\" license which prohibits commercial use.  \n",
        "\n",
        "[RedPajama](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama) is an effort to create an open-source clone of Llama.  It's a project to create leading open-source language models and starts by reproducing the LLaMA training dataset of over 1.2 trillion tokens. Leveraging this dataset, the team from [together.xyz](http://together.xyz) has just released initial versions of their 3B and 7B RedPajama models. Both of these come in a number of flavors including a [base model](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-3B-v1) and a couple of finetuned variants (an instruction-tuned variant and a chat-tuned variant). **All of these have been released under a liberal Apache-2.0 Open Source License. Making them suitable for commercial applications**\n",
        "\n",
        "Out of the box, the base model (given a sequence of words) has been trained to \"statistically\" predict what word should come next based on the very large dataset described above. As such, the language model has in a way compressed and encoded much of the information contained within that dataset and when prompted can regenerate information that it has learned, one token at a time. These generated sequences echo many of the ideas, concepts and \"thoughts\" that were encoded in the dataset, reflecting thoughts about society, humanity, general knowledge and more. You can sort of think of the base model as having compressed a large portion of the Internet into a set of a few billion numbers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "But while predicting what word comes next is a powerful capability, it is fairly limited in practical application. Enter the process of alignment or finetuning. As you might imagine, the base model has been exposed to many different patterns of written language, ranging from freeform prose, to poetry, Q&As, dialogue etc. Finetuning is about bringing one or more of these latent language patterns to the surface, so that the language model performs better at a specific desired behavior or task. A few of the more common downstream tasks that large language models have been proven to be good at include:\n",

        "* Document Summarization\n",
        "* Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "* Chatbot (Human/Bot. Something like a ChatGPT)\n",
        "* Instruction Following\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, I'll demonstrate finetuning the RedPJ model into an \"Instruction Following\" variant using the [Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) dataset. Once RedPJ has been finetuned for the task of Instruction Following, we'll expect our model to be able to take in a natural language instruction and be able to generate coherent responses to those instructions.  My goal here is two-fold, one to demonstrate the mechanics of how to finetune a LLM on a dataset of your own choosing and two to show the profound impact that finetuning can have on the behavior of a LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several approaches that we can take to finetuning an LLM model. Full finetuning involves using back propogation to iteratively modify all of the model weights, which can be quite resource intensive from a compute and a memory perspective. Another popular approach to finetuning is through the use of [LoRA adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).  LoRA is a technique that allows you to finetune a large language model on a much smaller GPU. It does this by freezing the base model weights and dynamically injecting trainable \"adapter\" layers into the model. The number of trainable parameters in these adapter layers are much much smaller than the base model. We'll also use [int8 quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339) of the base model weights to further reduce the amount of memory needed for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "One additional benefit, since LoRA adapters are a separate set of weights from the base model and are much smaller. You can have just one copy of the large base model weights and dynamically load different LoRA adapters weights to support multiple downstream tasks for the same shared base model weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later in this article, I'll demonstrate interacting with the base model before and after finetuning, so that you can see the effects of finetuning more clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The HuggingFace ecosystem, makes downloading, training, saving models and datasets very quick and easy. This notebook heavily leverages the HuggingFace libraries and platform.  \n",
        "\n",
        "_Note: This notebook should support any of the upcoming RedPajama model releases (bigger ones are coming... assuming you have enough VRAM on your GPU). I've trained and tested this notebook on both the 3B and 7B models that have been released so far._\n",
        "\n",
        "We can start by defining a few variables that will determine which specific base model that we're finetuning (either the 3B or the 7B model)."

Since we are finetuning on an instruction following task, we would like the model to respond to the instruction prompt succintly and then stop.  There are a number of ways to approach this, but the way I approach it here is to explicitly add a new token to represent end-of-stream, &lt;eos&gt; and use that eos token during training to teach the model when it should stop. Then during inference, we can use that token to recognize when the model is done responding."
