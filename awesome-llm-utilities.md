# Annotation, Conversational Information Retrieval, misc

* https://github.com/explosion/prodigy-openai-recipes - This repository contains example code on how to combine zero- and few-shot learning with a small annotation effort to obtain a high-quality dataset with maximum efficiency. Specifically, we use large language models available from OpenAI to provide us with an initial set of predictions, then spin up a Prodigy instance on our local machine to go through these predictions and curate them. This allows us to obtain a gold-standard dataset pretty quickly, and train a smaller, supervised model that fits our exact needs and use-case.
