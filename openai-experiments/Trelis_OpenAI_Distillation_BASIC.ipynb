            "---\n",
            "Response from gpt-4o for 'Are there any differences between touch rugby and rugby union?':\n",
            "Yes, there are several differences between touch rugby and rugby union, as they are distinct variations of the sport with different rules, objectives, and styles of play. Here are some of the key differences:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Contact**: \n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: As the name suggests, touch rugby is a minimal-contact sport. Instead of tackling, players stop the progress of the ball carrier by touching them with their hands. This makes the game safer and more accessible to a wider range of participants.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Rugby union is a full-contact sport where players tackle opponents to the ground to stop their progress. This involves a higher level of physicality and requires protective gear like mouthguards.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Team Size**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Typically played with six players per side on the field at any one time.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Played with 15 players per side in the traditional format. There is also a variant called rugby sevens, which features seven players per side.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Field Size**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: The field is smaller, usually around 70 meters long and 50 meters wide, which is about half the size of a standard rugby union field.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: The field is approximately 100 meters long and 70 meters wide.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Game Duration**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Matches are generally shorter, often consisting of two halves of 20 minutes each.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Standard matches are 80 minutes long, divided into two halves of 40 minutes each.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Scoring**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Points are scored by grounding the ball over the opponent's try line, similar to a try in rugby union, but there are no conversions, penalties, or drop goals.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Points can be scored in several ways, including tries, conversions, penalty goals, and drop goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Set Pieces**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: There are no scrums or lineouts. Restarting play after a touch is made involves a simple roll-ball.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Includes complex set pieces like scrums and lineouts, which are integral parts of the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Possession**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Teams have a set number of touches (usually six) to score before possession is turned over to the opposing team.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Possession is contested continuously, with turnovers occurring through various means like tackles, rucks, and interceptions.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Objective**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Focuses more on speed, agility, and teamwork, with an emphasis on running and passing.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Combines physicality with strategy, involving both running and tactical kicking.\n",
            "\n",
            "These differences make touch rugby a more accessible and less physically demanding version of the sport, often used for social play, training, or as an introduction to rugby for beginners.\n",
