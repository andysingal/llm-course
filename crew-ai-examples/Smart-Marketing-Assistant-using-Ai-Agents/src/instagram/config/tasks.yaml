    Here are some examples of the descriptions that you could use:
    - A realistic image of a living room with a modern design. The room should have a large window with a view of a cityscape. The color palette should be neutral, with a pop of color in the form of a red sofa. The room should be well-lit, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
    - A minimalist image of a desk with a laptop, a notebook, and a cup of coffee. The desk should be made of light wood, and the background should be a plain white wall. The image should convey a sense of focus and productivity.
    - A vibrant image of a tropical beach at sunset. The beach should be deserted, with palm trees swaying in the wind. The sky should be a mix of warm colors, with the sun setting on the horizon. The image should evoke a sense of relaxation and tranquility.
