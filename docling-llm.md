Docling-Graph turns documents into validated Pydantic objects, then builds a directed knowledge graph with explicit semantic relationships.

This transformation enables high-precision use cases in chemistry, finance, and legal domains, where AI must capture exact entity connections (compounds and reactions, instruments and dependencies, properties and measurements) rather than rely on approximate text embeddings.
