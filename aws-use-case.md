#### Application
[Strands Agents](https://dev.to/aws-builders/tying-it-all-together-how-strands-agents-weave-together-retail-performance-analysis-50p4)

Strands Agents is a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents. It is an open-source SDK by Amazon Web Services [AWS]. Strands comprise three key components: a language model, a system prompt, and a set of tools. Strands supports multiple agent architecture patterns, scaling from a single agent up to complex networks of agents.
