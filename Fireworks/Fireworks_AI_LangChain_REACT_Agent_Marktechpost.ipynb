            "ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the American company OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is based on large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o. ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.[2] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[3] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][5]\n",

            "ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[4] Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[6] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT \"Plus\", \"Pro\", \"Team\", and \"Enterprise\" subscriptions provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation, more capable AI models, and an increased usage limit.[7]\n",

            "By January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 102 million users in two months.[8][9] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[10] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[11] As of April 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.[12][13]\n",

            "ChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that were fine-tuned for conversational assistance, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini.[14] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[15][16] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[17] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.[15][18]\n",
