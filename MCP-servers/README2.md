Welcome to an exciting exploration of how we can harness the power of Google's cutting-edge Gemini language models using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework. In this cookbook, we'll take a look under the hood at a project designed to facilitate intelligent interactions by exposing Gemini's capabilities as accessible tools within an MCP environment.

This cost-effective AI solution uses an MCP server-client architecture where affordable Gemini models act as clients and specialized models as servers, offering developers powerful yet affordable options for specific use cases.

[News Agents](https://github.com/eugeneyan/news-agents)

A little experiment with Amazon Q, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and tmux to create a news aggregation system that runs entirely in your terminal. It fetches and summarizes articles from various news sources using multiple agents working in parallel.
