Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications.
