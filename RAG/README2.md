5. Altera’s new AI agents, powered by OpenAI’s o1 model, mimic the human brain with many modules operating in parallel - simulating cognitive functions like attention, memory, and social cognition. Here are some key insights…

> LLMs that predict next best token/thought/action will likely only be one part of an AGI / intelligent multi-agent system
> Environmental grounding, long term memory, planning and decision-making are critical component that require additional “modules” - a lot like the human brain
> Agents likely need more than just model alignment to be taught how or how not to think, talk, feel, and define intent
