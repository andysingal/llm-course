[How to manage conversation history in a ReAct Agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent-manage-message-history/)

[langchain-swarm](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py)

A Python library for creating swarm-style multi-agent systems using LangGraph. A swarm is a type of multi-agent architecture where agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.

This project is a simple research and podcast generation workflow that uses LangGraph with the unique capabilities of Google's Gemini 2.5 model family. It combines three useful features of the Gemini 2.5 model family. You can pass a research topic and, optionally, a YouTube video URL. The system will then perform research on the topic using search, analyze the video, combine the insights, and generate a report with citations as well as a short podcast on the topic for you.
