This project demonstrates a realistic Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow using LangGraph, embedded inside a Python FastAPI backend, with a React frontend. It is designed as a learning resource for developers interested in building interactive AI agent flows that pause for human input and then resume execution.
