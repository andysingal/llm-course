DRIFT Search introduces a new approach to local search queries by including community information in the search process. This greatly expands the breadth of the queryâ€™s starting point and leads to retrieval and usage of a far higher variety of facts in the final answer. This addition expands the GraphRAG query engine by providing a more comprehensive option for local search, which uses community insights to refine a query into detailed follow-up questions.
