    "# **Pydantic AI Agent Framework Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "The Pydantic AI Agent framework provides tools for creating agentic AI systems with structured validation, streamlined data handling, and flexible execution models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Agent Execution Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "There are three primary ways to run an agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`agent.run()`**:\n",
    "   - **Type**: Coroutine.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: `RunResult` containing a completed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`agent.run_sync()`**:\n",
    "   - **Type**: Synchronous function.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: `RunResult` containing a completed response.\n",
    "   - **Internally**: Uses `asyncio.run(self.run())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`agent.run_stream()`**:\n",
    "   - **Type**: Coroutine.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: `StreamedRunResult`.\n",
    "   - **Details**:\n",
    "     - Provides methods like `stream()` for text streaming in chunks.\n",
    "     - Use this for progressive text generation or interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Text Streaming**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case**\n",
    "Agents can stream textual outputs progressively, making them suitable for real-time applications or conversational AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Initialization Notes**\n",
    "Before running agents, ensure your environment is set up with all required dependencies. Use the following steps to initialize and verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check kernel configurations.\n",
    "- Install necessary Python packages using `pip` or equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example Code Snippets**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Agent Run**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = await agent.run(\"Your input text here\")\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

      "Creating a Pydantic data class to represent AI models or their configurations is a structured and type-safe way to manage data. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python, which uses Python type hints to provide user-friendly errors when data is invalid. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to create a Pydantic model for AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Pydantic:**\n",
      "   Ensure you have Pydantic installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install pydantic\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define the Pydantic Model:**\n",
      "   You can define a Pydantic model by creating a class that inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel`. Each attribute of the class represents a field in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Type Annotations:**\n",
      "   Use type annotations for each field to specify the data type. This not only provides clarity but also enables Pydantic to perform data validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Default Values and Validation:**\n",
      "   You can provide default values and add custom validation methods to ensure your model behaves as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of creating a Pydantic data class for a simple AI model configuration:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator\n",
      "from typing import List, Optional\n",
      "\n",
      "class AIModelConfig(BaseModel):\n",
      "    model_name: str\n",
      "    input_size: int\n",
      "    output_size: int\n",
      "    hidden_layers: List[int] = Field(description=\"List of neuron counts for each hidden layer\")\n",
      "    activation_function: str = \"relu\"\n",
      "    learning_rate: float = Field(gt=0, lt=1, default=0.001, description=\"Learning rate must be between 0 and 1\")\n",
      "\n",
      "    @validator('activation_function')\n",
      "    def check_activation_function(cls, value):\n",
      "        valid_functions = {'relu', 'sigmoid', 'tanh'}\n",
      "        if value not in valid_functions:\n",
      "            raise ValueError(f'Activation function must be one of {valid_functions}')\n",
      "        return value\n",
      "\n",
      "    class Config:\n",
      "        allow_mutation = False\n",
      "        anystr_strip_whitespace = True\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage\n",
      "model_config = AIModelConfig(\n",
      "    model_name=\"example_model\",\n",
      "    input_size=784,\n",
      "    output_size=10,\n",
      "    hidden_layers=[512, 256, 128]\n",
      ")\n",
      "\n",
      "print(model_config)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Inheritance from `BaseModel`:** This allows your class to benefit from Pydantic’s features, such as validation and serialization.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Type Hints and Fields:** Type hints are crucial for Pydantic to know what kind of data it's dealing with. The `Field` function provides additional metadata and validation constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Validators:** These are methods that allow custom checks, ensuring values conform to specified rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Configuration Class:** The nested `Config` class lets you control behaviors like immutability (using `allow_mutation`) and whitespace management (`anystr_strip_whitespace`).\n",
      "\n",
      "Building and utilizing Pydantic models like this can greatly enhance the reliability and maintainability of your AI data workflows. Always remember to keep the data validation strict yet accommodating to avoid common pitfalls that can occur with dynamic data structures. If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!\n"
