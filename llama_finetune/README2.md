[SFT_HF_TOOL_CHOICE](https://github.com/samugit83/TheGradientPath/tree/master)

A curated learning journey through modern machine learning and artificial intelligence.

This repository blends concise Python scripts, richly commented Jupyter notebooks, and step-by-step video tutorials to help you build intuition from first principles to state-of-the-art models. Every concept is paired with runnable code so you can tinker, break things, and understand the gradients under the hood.

[Tinker Cookbook - Complete Training Patterns](https://github.com/sundial-org/skills/blob/main/skills/tinker/SKILL.md)

Tinker Cookbook provides two levels of abstraction for fine-tuning language models:

- High-Level Cookbook API: Declarative configuration with chz, structured dataset builders, automatic training loops
- Low-Level Tinker API: Manual control over training steps, direct ServiceClient usage, custom training loops
Choose based on your needs:

Use Cookbook for standard SFT workflows with built-in datasets and patterns
Use Low-Level API for custom training logic, research experiments, or fine-grained control
