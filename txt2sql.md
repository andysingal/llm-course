[SkyRL-SQL: Matching GPT-4o and o4-mini on Text2SQL with Multi-Turn RL](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-sql)

In this post, we share early results on enabling multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for Text-to-SQL, where we teach an LLM to iteratively build and refine SQL queries using feedback from databases. We introduce a simple, data-efficient, and scalable multi-turn RL training pipeline for Text-to-SQL task, built on top of VeRL and SearchR1.
