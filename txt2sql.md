[SkyRL-SQL: Matching GPT-4o and o4-mini on Text2SQL with Multi-Turn RL](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-sql)

In this post, we share early results on enabling multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for Text-to-SQL, where we teach an LLM to iteratively build and refine SQL queries using feedback from databases. We introduce a simple, data-efficient, and scalable multi-turn RL training pipeline for Text-to-SQL task, built on top of VeRL and SearchR1.

How to deal with Large databases when doing SQL Q & A Langchain vs MCP Approach

[anyquery](https://github.com/julien040/anyquery)

Anyquery is a SQL query engine that allows you to run SQL queries on pretty much anything. It supports querying files, databases, and apps (e.g. Apple Notes, Notion, Chrome, Todoist, etc.). It's built on top of SQLite and uses plugins to extend its functionality.
